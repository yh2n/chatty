# multiroom chat-app

## Synopsis

This projects is intended to be an add-on to a previously released application: a restaurant scheduling application allowing employees
to trade shifts and set their availability on a weekly basis. 
If trading shifts cannot be facilitated by the current UI only --e.g they are maing tentative plans, waiting for managers approval or other conditions-- they may want to exchange more details in real time. That feature would allow them to communicate more extensvely 
without quitting they're restaurant app.
